        Hi!
        <br>
        We have a problem with one of our servers. We are working on fixing this issue.
        <br>
        <strong>Until this server is back up again, betterplace.org will be shut down.</strong>
        <br>
        This will probably take until about 13:00 German time.
        <br>
        We will update this page, once we know more.
      </p>
